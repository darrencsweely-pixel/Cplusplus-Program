Project Summary:
The CornerGrocer program was built to help a grocery store track the frequency of items purchased. It reads data from a text file, counts how many times each item appears, and displays the results in a simple menu format. This project focused on applying C++ programming fundamentals like file input/output, loops, functions, and maps to solve a real-world business problem efficiently.

What I Did Well:
I structured the program clearly, keeping the logic organized inside functions. I also made sure to use consistent formatting and meaningful variable names so the code was easy to follow. Handling user input and displaying the results in a simple, menu-driven format worked especially well.

What Could Be Improved:
If I improved the project, I’d focus on adding better input validation to prevent crashes if the user enters unexpected values. I’d also expand the program to allow dynamic file selection instead of using a fixed file name. These changes would make it more flexible and user-friendly.

Challenges and Solutions:
One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to read data from the input file and count each item efficiently. I solved this by using a map to store item names as keys and their counts as values. Testing the logic in small parts helped catch errors before putting everything together.

Transferable Skills:
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of data structures, especially maps, and how to use them for counting and organizing data. I also practiced file handling and user-interface design in a console environment — skills that will transfer directly to more advanced programming tasks.

Maintainability and Readability:
I used consistent indentation, added comments throughout the code, and broke larger tasks into smaller functions. This keeps the program easy to read, test, and update later if new features are needed.
